Generate visualizations of GitHub user and repository statistics using GitHub
Actions.

## Disclaimer

If the project is used with an access token that has sufficient permissions to
read private repositories, it may leak details about those repositories in
error messages.

For more information on inaccuracies, see issue
[#2](https://github.com/jstrieb/github-stats/issues/2),
[#3](https://github.com/jstrieb/github-stats/issues/3), and
